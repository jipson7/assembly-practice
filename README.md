A collection of assembly code projects I used to practice NASM with.

they include

arrayCreator - creates an array of a specified length and allows the user to fill it

crypt - takes in a message and encryption key and uses an XOR algorithm to encrypt and decrypt it

fib - calculates the nth term of the fibonacci sequence, as specified by the user

palindrome - takes a string and declares whether the string is a palindrome or not

rand.asm - a pseudo random number generator using the current system time
